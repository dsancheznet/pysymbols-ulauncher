# Symbols Extension for ULauncher

![Interface](./images/capture.png)

## A very simple extension for ULauncher to get special symbols

The keyword is set to `symb` and the available options are:

- `-->` for right pinting arrows (that was kind of obvious, right? Wait there is more...)
- `<--` for left pointing arrows (didn't I tell you?)
- `<->` for to tip arrows
- `UP>` for upward  pointing arrows
- `DN>` for downward pointing arrows
- `CHECK` for all kind of checkmarks ( accept **and** cancel )
- `FRAC` for fraction symbols ( not all are available in every font )
- `HEART` for various hart symbols (I'm a romantic, ya'know)
- `MATH` for various mathematical symbols
- `SUBNUM` for subscript numbers
- `SUPNUM` for superscript numbers
- `MAC` for MacOS symbols such as command, control or option keys


## What's to come

I will be including more sets in the list as soon as I'll need them. If you'd like to have a special set included, please feel free to submit a patch.
